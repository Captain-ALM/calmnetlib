# Captain ALM Network Library (Java)

This is the java network library with support for SSL, standard cipher encryption (.net Compatible!), fragmentation, packet object and network stream support.

This requires the [calmstdcrypt library](https://code.mrmelon54.xyz/alfred/calmstdcrypt), which is my cryptographic wrapper library.

This library contains streams that can wrap both Socket and DatagramSocket objects.
Sending large amounts over UDP is also do-able using the fragmentation part of the library.

This library targets Java 8.
